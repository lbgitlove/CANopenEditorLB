# Python Port Workspace

This directory hosts planning assets and the implementation for porting the
CANopenNode Editor from C# to Python 3.

## Structure
- `config/` â€“ Default configuration templates committed to version control.
- `data/` â€“ Sanitized reference EDS/XDD files and canonical CANopenNode `.c`/`.h` fixtures.
- `docs/` â€“ Analysis, requirements, porting guide, and environment setup notes.
- `src/canopen_node_editor/` â€“ Python package containing application code.
- `tests/` â€“ Pytest suite for validating the Python implementation.
- `requirements.txt` â€“ Python dependencies required for development.

## Getting Started
1. Follow the [Phase 0 environment setup](docs/environment_setup.md) to create a
   dedicated virtual environment.
2. Activate the environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd python_port
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ..
   ```
   The requirements file installs the project in editable mode so that the
   ``canopen_node_editor`` module is available on the Python path without
   additional configuration.
3. Launch the editor GUI:
   ```bash
   python -m canopen_node_editor
   ```
   The command boots the Qt application with dockable object dictionary, PDO editor, validation report view, and a command palette. Use Ctrl+K to open the palette or View â†’ Toggle Dark Mode to switch themes. To validate the installation without opening the GUI, run ``python -m canopen_node_editor --check``.

## Running Tests

Use pytest (with pytest-qt) to run both logic and GUI smoke tests:
```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen pytest python_port/tests
```

## Current Status

- âœ… Phase 0 â€“ environment and scaffolding complete.
- âœ… Phase 1 â€“ core data model, format parsers, validation engine, and CANopenNode `.c`/`.h` export covered by regression tests.
- âœ… Phase 2 â€“ application services for settings, profile discovery, network management, and HTML reporting.
- âœ… Phase 3 â€“ Qt GUI with tabbed workspace, dockable tools, theming, and command palette.
- ðŸ”„ Phase 4 â€“ integration packaging updates and environment verification helpers.
