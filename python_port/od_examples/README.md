# Object Dictionary Examples

This directory collects small example object dictionaries that can be opened
by the Python port of the CANopenNode Editor.

## Included Samples
- `demo_device.xdd` â€“ canonical CANopen demo device exported from the C#
  editor.

The files are copied from `python_port/data/samples` so they can be used for
discovery and manual testing without navigating through the data directory.
