# Object Dictionary Examples

This directory collects small example object dictionaries that can be opened
by the Python port of the CANopenNode Editor.

## Included Samples
- `demo_device.xdd` – canonical CANopen demo device exported from the C#
  editor.
- `od.xdd` – realistic network profile exported by the C# editor and used by
  the main branch for regression testing.

The files are copied from `python_port/data/samples` or the original test data
so they can be used for discovery and manual testing without navigating
through less discoverable directories.
